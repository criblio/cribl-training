      comment: Aggregations does a number of calculations on bytes and timetaken and
        outputs records every 10 seconds. Note, that in this example URI is very
        high cardinality, and so Aggregating only results in a eventcount
        reduction of around 20%. This is important to note when Aggregating, as
        the cardinality of your group bys and the time window will greatly
        affect the size of the dataset.
